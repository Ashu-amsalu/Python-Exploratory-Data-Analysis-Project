# Python-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-Project
### 🛠️ Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a TikTok dataset to uncover insights about video performance, content, and author behaviour. 
The dataset includes information about video metadata, engagement metrics, author verification, and ban status.
    
The goal of this analysis is to identify trends, patterns, and relationships to inform content strategy or future modelling. Dataset Description

### 🛢️ Dataset
The dataset is stored in a single table named tiktok_dataset.csv with the following columns:
| Column Name                | Description                              |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| claim_status               | Video claim or opinion            |
| video_id                   | Unique identifier for each video         |
| video_duration_sec         | Duration of the video in seconds         |
| video_transcription_text   | Transcribed text of the video           |
| verified_status            | Author verification status ✅             |
| author_ban_status          | Author status (active, banned, review)  |
| video_view_count           | Total number of views 👀                        |
| video_like_count           | Total number of likes ❤️                        |
| video_share_count          | Total number of shares 🔄                       |
| video_download_count       | Total number of downloads ⬇️                    |
| video_comment_count        | Total number of comments 💬                     |


### 🎯 Objective of EDA
    -	Analyze video engagement metrics (views, likes, shares, comments, downloads)
    -	Examine the effect of author verification and ban status on engagement
    -	Explore patterns in video duration and transcription content
    -	Detect anomalies, missing values, and outliers
    -	Generate insights through visualisations and summary statistics
### 🗝️ Key Features
    -	Data cleaning and preprocessing
    -	Descriptive statistics (mean, median, min, max)
    -	Handling missing or inconsistent data
    -	Visualization of trends and distributions using Matplotlib and Seaborn
    -	Comparative analysis of engagement metrics across different author_ban_status and verified_statu
### 📊 Libraries Used
